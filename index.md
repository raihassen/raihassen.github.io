# Google

* ["Cracking the Coding Interview"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984782850/ref=as_li_tl?Pre-Order+on+Amazon=Now+Available+on+Amazon) is definitely my top resource! 

* [A helpful blog to take a look at](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.co.uk/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html) - 100% read this 

* [Google code style guides](https://github.com/google/styleguide)

- [Google Research (incl. publications by Googlers)](https://research.google.com/)

- [Take a look at this Cracking the Coding video. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEJzOhC5ZtQ)

Also take a look at the sites below, which have sample questions which are quite similar to those which you will experience in your interviews:
* <https://leetcode.com/>
* <https://www.codeforces.com/>
* <https://www.hackerrank.com/>
* <https://www.topcoder.com>
	To best prepare (this is a must!) go onto  www.topcoder.com  Start with a TopCoder HS Single Round Match (SRM) or two and then move on to a standard TopCoder SRM if you can. The SRMs can take anywhere between 30 minutes and a couple of hours  & try to practice as much as you can: 1 hour a day will make a big difference to getting you interview ready
